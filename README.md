# Dextran Analysis
Dextran analysis is used to measure vascular permeability in live or fixed tissue, providing insights into how blood vessels behave under different physiological or pathological conditions. In cancer research, fluorescently labeled dextran serves as a tracer to detect localized leakage events, which often occur near tumor-associated structures such as TMEM (Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis) sites. By analyzing dextran uptake or leakage, researchers can quantify changes in vascular integrity, evaluate drug effects, and better understand mechanisms of tumor cell intravasation and metastasis.

# Project
This repository provides Fiji macros for quantifying dextran leakage in fixed tissue images, enabling assessment of vascular permeability and TMEM doorway activity.
